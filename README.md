**## What is IO SHIELD?**
It is an Industrial Automation Raspberry Pi shield that is compatible with 3G Modules and many programming languages like C, C++, JAVA AND PYTHON.

Industrial automation and IoT (internet of things) sectors have benefited a lot from Raspberry Pi. With IO Shield support Raspberry Pi, the high CPU capacity, camera input, video playback and easy programmable IO pins of Raspberry Pi can be used to remotely control motors, sensors, industrial machines and home electronics applications. 

Usage Level: Basic / Intermediate / Advanced
